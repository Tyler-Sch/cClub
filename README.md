# Cooking Club

Inspired by Tinder, I created a website for finding recipes to cook.
Add the ones you want to a recipe list, automatically generate a grocery list,
and get cooking. Many technologies have been used to create the base version
of this web page and I'm excited to build more onto it.

### Prerequisites:

For simple build:
```
  docker
  docker-compose

```

### Installation:
Set up system:
  create a directory and clone repository
```
  git clone https://github.com/wintermutestoothache/cClub.git
  cd cClub
```
for Dev version:
```
  docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up --build -d
