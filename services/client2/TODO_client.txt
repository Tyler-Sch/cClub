  - take out hard coded url in app
  - Log off
  - Change terneary operators to (condition && jsx) format
  - deal with errors from fetch requests
  - html for invalid username/password
  - add Bearer to JWT
  - Need catch for requests with invalid token

Search:
  - add search back in

Login:
  - refactor Login.js
    - can be split into smaller components
    - need to take out hard coded urls (should use environ variables)
  - focus should go onto login name when first going onto page


Recipe List:
  - after creating new list, the focus target list should move to new empty list
  - should sort recipes in order of last on
  - should sort recipe Lists in last modified
  # remove unsaved recipes
  # remove saved recipes
  - hover on recipe list menu
  - delete visible on hover ONLY in non-mobile
  - need save recipe button to work when attempting to save list that
    hasn't been created
  # duplicate recipes can be added by switching to other recipe lists (solved
    server side)
  - would be nice if recipe lists would change order if they had been worked
    on more recently. (might take care of itself if we store when last modded
    and sort by that date on the backend)
  - need to be able to delete recipeLists



Done:
- load recipes from saved id list
