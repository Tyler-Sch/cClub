  - take out hard coded url in app
  - Log off
  - Change terneary operators to (condition && jsx) format
  - deal with errors from fetch requests
  - html for invalid username/password
  - add Bearer to JWT
  - Need catch for requests with invalid token
  - make overall height larger website jumps less

Search:
  - add search back in

Login:
  - refactor Login.js
    - can be split into smaller components
    - need to take out hard coded urls (should use environ variables)
  - focus should go onto login name when first going onto page


Recipe List:
  - delete visible on hover ONLY in non-mobile
  - need save recipe button to work when attempting to save list that
    hasn't been created
    server side)
  - should sort recipe Lists in last modified
  - would be nice if recipe lists would change order if they had been worked
    on more recently. (might take care of itself if we store when last modded
    and sort by that date on the backend)
  - need to be able to delete recipeLists
  - BUG: when going back to recipe list from any other pages,
    the recipe list that was in scope changes back to the null ("Recipes") value
    but the previous saved recipes remains, this also prevents delete operations
    on that list
      - could move targetRecipe varaible up to users so it is persistent
      - could take care of it within RecipeList, but maybe complicated
  # load recipes from saved id list
  # duplicate recipes can be added by switching to other recipe lists (solved
  # delete unsaved recipes
  # delete saved recipes
  # after creating new list, the focus target list should move to new empty list
  # hover on recipe list menu



Done:
