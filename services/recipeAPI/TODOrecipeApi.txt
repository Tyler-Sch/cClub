Overall:
    - refactor into blueprint and make with create_app
    - refactor test to take them out of main folder
    - create test database with a limited amount of recipes to ensure
      accuracy of search queries and database calls
    - figure out a way to test the database effectively (might need some
      raw sql helpers)

server:
    - handle request with empty query string in search
