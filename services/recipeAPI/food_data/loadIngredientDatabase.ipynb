    "Takes ingredient table in the database (constucted by stockdb) and adds ingredient information from a usda food resource webpage. Current columns are an id number, a food group which the item belongs, and a short description of the item. \n",
    "\n",
    "The items were linked with the usda info using levenstein distance between the ingredient name in the database and 2 different descriptions in the USDA data. There were two promising ways of finding matches, the first was to use the simple description of the item ie: (lentil, LENTIL), and the second was another which tested a more complicated description string: ie (lentil, [canned lentil, raw, descriptor, etc]). In the end, I took both distances and compared their scores. Scores had to be over 75 to be considered. If both were over 75, I took the highest, matched it to the USDA dataframe and took the first result. There is massive room for improvement in this technique, but from a preliminary skimming it looks like it worked well enough\n",

    "This works fairly decently, but is very slow. \n",
    "It should be looked at again when the ingredient model is cleaned up. \n",

    "Some notes:\n",
    "    - It handles plural very poorly. ie carrot vs carrots give very  different results\n",
    "    - The code is a bit of a mess, and needs to cleaned up given time\n",
    "    - it would be beneficial to link the weights to the products as well. \n",
    "    - this new table should be split into 2. There is a lot of redundant info that can be stored better"
